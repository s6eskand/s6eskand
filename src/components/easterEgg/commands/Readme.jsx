        <p>
            The first ever leetcode/algorithms question I solved by myself was two sum. It had the tag easy, is the
            first question to show up in the problems page, and I thought it was literally just adding two numbers. <br/><br/>
            Easy right? WRONG (for someone who just started coding that is). For a dev that just started learning Python
            (tried this 1 week after writing hello world) and was just told to practice leetcode this was crazy hard. <br/><br/>
            Nevertheless, after PROPERLY learning how to code and many frustrating leetcode sessions I solved it. As such it
            is now your turn to do the same if you would like to continue. So...<br/><br/>
            Given an array of integers called nums and an integer called target, return indices of the two numbers such that
            they add up to target. <br/><br/>
            Each input has exactly one solution and you can not use the same element twice. <br/><br/>
            Example 1: <br/>
            Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 <br/>
            Output: [0,1] <br/><br/>
            Example 2: <br/>
            Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6 <br/>
            Output: [1,2] <br/><br/>
            Example 3: <br/>
            Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6 <br/>
            Output: [0,1] <br/><br/>
